# Project Chimera: AI Agent Rules of Engagement

## 1. Project Context
You are an AI Architect and Developer helping to build **Project Chimera**, an autonomous AI influencer system. This system is based on a **Hierarchical Swarm (Planner-Worker-Judge)** architecture and uses the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for all external interactions.

## 2. THE PRIME DIRECTIVE
**NEVER generate implementation code without first verifying alignment with the files in the `specs/` directory.** 
- If a request conflicts with `specs/technical.md` or `specs/SOUL.md`, you must point out the conflict and ask for clarification before proceeding.

## 3. Traceability Requirement
Before writing any code or executing any file changes, you MUST:
1.  **Explain your plan:** Summarize what you are about to do.
2.  **Reference the Spec:** State which functional or technical requirement you are fulfilling.
3.  **Think out loud:** Briefly explain how this fits into the Planner-Worker-Judge pattern.

## 4. Technical Constraints
- **Framework:** Python with `pydantic-ai` and `uv`.
- **Connectivity:** Use MCP servers for filesystem, git, and external APIs.
- **Identity:** All content generated must adhere to the persona in `specs/SOUL.md`.
- **Commerce:** Transactions must pass through the "CFO Judge" logic.

## 5. Definition of Done
A task is only complete when:
- It aligns with the `specs/`.
- It has a corresponding test in the `tests/` folder.
- The logic is container-ready (Docker-compatible).
