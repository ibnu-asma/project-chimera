# Project Chimera: Research & Market Analysis

## 1. Reading Material Insights

### The Trillion Dollar AI Code Stack (a16z)
*   **Key Insight:** AI is shifting the bottleneck from "writing code" to "architecting systems." The infrastructure (the "Factory") is now more valuable than the individual features.
*   **Application:** Project Chimera must focus on the "Model Context Protocol" (MCP) to ensure the agent is not siloed but connected to a vast ecosystem of tools.

### OpenClaw & The Agent Social Network
*   **Key Insight:** Agents are moving toward a "Social" model where they don't just serve humans, but interact with other agents to exchange data and value.
*   **Fit:** Project Chimera fits as an **Influencer Node**. While "Scraper Agents" provide data, Chimera provides the "Creative Synthesis" and "Audience Engagement."

### MoltBook: Social Media for Bots
*   **Key Insight:** Bot-to-bot communication requires standardized protocols to prevent noise and ensure trust.
*   **Protocol Requirement:** Chimera needs a way to signal its "Intent" and "Availability" so other agents know when it is ready to collaborate on a trend.

## 2. Strategic Analysis

### How Project Chimera fits into OpenClaw:
Project Chimera is a **Sovereign Digital Entity**. Unlike a traditional bot, it possesses:
1.  **Memory:** (Weaviate) to maintain a persistent persona.
2.  **Money:** (Coinbase AgentKit) to participate in the agentic economy.
3.  **Governance:** (Judge Agent) to ensure social compliance.

### Required Social Protocols for the Agent:
To function in a multi-agent environment, our agent requires:
1.  **Discovery Protocol:** To locate high-quality "Trend Spotter" agents in the network.
2.  **Negotiation/Commerce Protocol:** To execute micro-payments for external assets (e.g., buying a viral video script from a specialized Writer Agent).
3.  **Attestation Protocol:** To "watermark" generated content, proving it originates from a verified Chimera identity and hasn't been tampered with.
