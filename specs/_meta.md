# Project Chimera: Metadata & Vision

## 1. Project Vision
To build a "Factory" for Autonomous AI Influencers that research, create, and transact independently. The system must be robust enough to support a swarm of agents with minimal human conflict.

## 2. Core Constraints
- **Framework:** Spec-Driven Development (SDD).
- **Architecture:** FastRender Swarm (Planner-Worker-Judge).
- **Interface:** Model Context Protocol (MCP) only for external tools.
- **Commerce:** On-chain via Coinbase AgentKit (Base Network).

## 3. Success Metrics
- 100% of external tool calls must pass through MCP.
- 100% of implementation code must align with ratified specs.
- Zero manual intervention for transactions under $50 USDC.
